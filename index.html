            <h3>Formula 1</h3>
            <p>I started watching it since 2016-17 and mostly liked it however my perception of it changed in a positive way after 2021 which I consider the best season of this decade </p>
            <p>This season Mercedes were not the only team with competitive car which led to amazing battle with RedBull team that was ended in very contradictory way in Abu-Dhabi(last race of the season) where both drivers had similar points at the start so the winner would win the championship</p>
            <p>When Mercedes started to dominate the race one of the drivers caused red flag which meant that all cars will need to slow down and that gap between the cars would decrease, which was really good for Redbull's driver Max Verstappen who was 10 seconds behind Lewis Hamilton(leader of the race)</p>
            <p>Another fact that was playing in favor of RedBull is that while Max Verstappen had fresh tires Lewis didnt want to finish to not get undercutted by Max ,however it played even worse for him because he needed to defend against his opponent with old tires</p>
            <p>With only 1 lap remaining both cars started to race each other and in intensive fight RedBull got ahead of Mercedes and Max Verstappen took his 1st championship this year and didnt let Lewis Hamilton break Michael Schumacher's record by taking his 8th championship</p>

            <h3>Aircrafts</h3>
            <p>My fanatism of military aviation started from playing Battlefield 4. I used to wait for minutes to get my favourite F-35 or Su-57 to try to dominate the skies while other players annoyed me with anti-air systems or long range rockets, however it didnt break my will to fly aircrafts again and again.</p>
            <p>After this i started learning more about actual jets in order to play more complicated aviation-simulators like DCS(Digital Combat Simulator) which considered one of the hardest to learn. It took me around 2 weeks just to understand how to switch between different types of rockets and be somehow able to understand how radars work.</p>
            <p>And all this time was only spend on learning basic Su-25 which considered as starters without difficult avionics. Next step was learning air-to-air and air-to-ground fights.</p>
            <p>When i first played this game i thought that it will be easy to learn basics of jet controls and be able to perform simple air-to-ground missions and even if it wont i would just turn Youtube and seek for answers, little i knew that i would need to watch 1 hour long manual to Su-25 and then if it was needed seek for ans2es in special pdf file that consisted of over 200 pages</p>
